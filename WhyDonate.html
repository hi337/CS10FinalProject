      Through donating your old prescription eyeglasses to CLERC (Lions Clubs

      Glasses are crucial for everyone due to their significant impact on
      education, and therefore productivity and quailty of life. By providing
      glasses we can help people in developing countries overcome visual
      impairments, enabling them to read, learn, and fully participate in
      educational activities.
