      The Canadian Lions Eyeglass Recycling Centre (CLERC) is a non-profit
      affiliated with Lions Clubs International. Their main goal is to collect,
      sort, and recycle used eyeglasses. CLERC provides affordable eyewear to
      individuals in need, both locally and globally. They collect donated
      eyeglasses from individuals, professionals, and organizations, sort them
      by prescription and condition, and distribute them to partners for
      redistribution. CLERC's work improves vision and quality of life for
      underserved communities. They bridge the gap between eyewear demand and
      accessibility by recycling used glasses. This effort reduces waste,
      promotes sustainability, and collaborates with Lions Clubs and partners to
      reach those in need. CLERC's success relies on dedicated volunteers and
      support from stakeholders. They make a positive impact by improving vision
      health and access to eyewear for individuals facing financial constraints.
      CLERC's work showcases community-driven initiatives in healthcare and
      inclusive vision care.
